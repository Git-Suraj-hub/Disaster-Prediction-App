# Disaster Prediction Application 

The Disaster Prediction App is an application created to provide its users with real-time information on disasters occurring around the world. All the user needs to do is input the name of the location and it will provide them with the temperature, humidity, and wind speed of the location. In addition, the application will also inform the user of any dangers related to natural disasters. 
The application uses a geocoding API that provides it with relevant data for locations across the globe. Furthermore, it is equipped with a catastrophe API which provides the necessary information in regards to natural disasters. 
We leveraged AI through the use of Natural Language Processing(NLP) making it easy for users to interact with the Application while providing credible intelligence.

## To effectively run the application

```bash
Use the  python virtualenv 
```

Run Python the train_model.py to note the accuracy of our application after several tests done.
